### Explanations

The vertical dark red lines mark the coming into effect of two major government measures: a partial lockdown on November 2nd (called **lockdown light** in Germany; essentially restrictions on personal contacts, closing of restaurants/cafés/bars, except for takeaway, ban on public events, closing of leisure and sports facilities as well as all body care related services, except for necessary medical care), and a tighter lockdown (called **hard lockdown** in Germany; lockdown light plus closing of all shops except for essential supplies and services, closing of schools).


With effect from March 1st (vertical green line), the German government has decided to take first steps towards a **cautious re-opening** of the economy and the education sector. From March 1st onwards hairdressers may open their shops again; the same applies to schools and child care institutions, depending on decisions on the federal state level. Later during week of March 1st the government decided to allow further re-openings according to a plan stipulating five opening phases the first of which is considered to be the March 1st opening of hairdressers and schools. Phases according to the plan will be take effect locally on the county level, depending on the 7-day-incidence rate of the county. Details are available from the [federal government](https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-de/themen/coronavirus/fuenf-oeffnungsschritte-1872120)
